        <p>Be careful on the shivers and glacier erosion. Indeed, he can be current that the latter move very quickly and so cause cracks in which the capsule could be dropped. Avoid at all costs arising, even on a place which look solid. Nothing is stable in this dimension.</p>

        <h3>Testimonies of test drivers</h3>
        <p><b>Aymeric 28-year-old:</b><br/>"What I saw overtakes any understanding, I really thank the climatic phenomenon which allowed the cast iron of ices, to live in a similar world … How awful! That really allowed me to be more clement on the weather of our own dimension ! I would never be disappointed on a rainy day, I shall say to myself that that could be much worse!"</p>
        <p class="margin"><b>Alice 56-year-old:</b><br/>"Being an real fan of the climatic phenomena, I was really excited at the idea of visiting a world where the ice age would not have come to an end ! And what I saw there did not disappoint me! The humanity always living with animal species present since the prehistory? That is what I was able to observe and trust me, it is really surprising!"</p>
